# Semantic Release POC

Proof-of-concept for using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to automatically enforce semantic versioning and create changelogs.

Check out the `Releases` tab of this repository - everything was generated automatically!

I've also installed a Github bot that will validate whether the title of a PR conforms to semantic versioning.

This means developers can continue to write as many commits as they want, without conforming to any structure. Only when creating a PR will the developer be responsible for writing a title that is compatible with semver.
